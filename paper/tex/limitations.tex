\section{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lambda
\begin{enumerate}
\item Maximum runtime of 5 minutes.
\item 512MB of disk space. This is bad if the program has large executables or lots of output.
\item Can't kill an instance once it has started.
\item Triggers are good for one file, but if you need a trigger when multiple files occur, you have to have a trigger for each file.
\item Cannot use AMIs. If there are dependencies, you must upload every time unless they can fit in a 50MB file. Sometimes you'll be placed in an old container that happens to have the dependencies you need, but you can't rely on it.
\item Only allows 100 concurrent Lambdas per zone.
\item No triggers for timeouts or failures.
\item It's not easy to navigate the output logs.
\end{enumerate}
\item General
\begin{enumerate}
\item JavaScript is the only unifying language.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
